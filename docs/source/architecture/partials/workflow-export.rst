Export Cluster
--------------

All of the rendered templates for a cluster can be exported to a zip file for ease of distribution and for import into further openFlightHPC Tools. To export the current cluster's files, simply::

    [root@myhost ~]# bin/architect export
    Exported: /root/underware-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.zip

The exported file will be tagged with the date and time of the export.
